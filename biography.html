            Cillian Murphy (/ˈkɪliən/ KILL-ee-ən;[1] born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor. His works encompass both stage
            and screen,
            and his accolades include an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award.
            He made his professional debut in Enda Walsh's 1996 play Disco Pigs, a role he later reprised in the 2001
            screen adaptation
            . His early film credits include the horror film 28 Days Later (2002), the dark comedy Intermission (2003),
            the thriller
            Red Eye (2005), the Irish war drama The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), and the science fiction thriller
            Sunshine (2007).
            He played a transgender Irish woman in the comedy-drama Breakfast on Pluto (2005), which earned him his
            first Golden Globe Award nomination.
            Murphy began his collaboration with filmmaker Christopher Nolan in 2005,
            playing the Scarecrow in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012) as well as appearing in Inception (2010) and
            Dunkirk (2017). He gained greater prominence
            for his role as Tommy Shelby in the BBC period drama series Peaky Blinders (2013–2022) and for starring in
            the horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II (2020).
            Murphy portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023), for which he won the BAFTA and Academy
            Award for Best Actor.

        <p>
            In 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend Yvonne McGuinness, whom he met at one of his rock band's
            shows in 1996.
            [134] They lived in Dublin until 2001 when they moved to London so his wife could attend the Royal College
            of Art.
            After 14 years, they moved back to Dublin in 2015. They have two sons, born in 2005 and 2007.[135][136]
            Murphy was raised Catholic. He stated that he had been verging on agnosticism until his role as a physicist
            and astronaut in
            the 2007 film Sunshine, at which point his views shifted towards atheism.[137][138] In 2019, he said the
            Catholic faith still shaped his morality.
            He was a vegetarian for around 15 years, which he said happened because he was "worried about getting mad
            cow disease" rather than a moral decision.[141]
            He also had qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.[142] He began eating meat again to bulk up for
            his role in Peaky Blinders.[141] In a 2022 interview,
            he said he had returned to vegetarianism.
